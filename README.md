# Getting started with React Typescript template

### `Add OpenApi specification file (swagger.yaml)`

File can be added as a Git submodule, which helps the development with different spec versions:

```sh
  git submodule add git@github.com:example-api-spec.git
```

### `Update api spec generator command`

Change the command inside *package.json* to match the added API specification file location

```json
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build-client": "... -i example-api-spec/swagger.yaml ..."
  }
```

### `Add environment variables`

To add necessary environment variables, create .env file to project root folder and write variables inside it with following syntax:

```
REACT_APP_EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=variable-value
REACT_APP_EXAMPLE_API_URL=https://example-api.example.com
...
```

### `Update public folder contents to match the project`

* Change title and description in *index.html*
* Update *favicon.ico*, *logo192.png* and *logo512.png*
* Update names and icon references in *manifest.json*
